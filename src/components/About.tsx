              I'm a passionate software developer focused on crafting intuitive and responsive web applications.
              My expertise lies in React, TypeScript, and modern front-end technologies, and I'm always eager to learn
              and implement new tools that enhance user experience.

              I enjoy translating ideas into scalable and maintainable code. Whether collaborating on a team or working
              independently, I bring a detail-oriented and solution-driven mindset to every project.

              Outside of coding, Iâ€™m curious about UI/UX design and continuously seek to bridge the gap between
              functionality and aesthetics in web applications.
